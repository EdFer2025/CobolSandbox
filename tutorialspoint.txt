COBOL: Common Business-Oriented Language

Use Business Oriented developed in 1959
COBOL was designed for business-oriented applications related to financial domain, defense domain, etc. 
It can handle huge volumes of data because of its advanced file handling capabilities.
Generally COBOL is not used for front-end web development, 
however it can be integrated with web services and back-end systems to support web applications.

DIVISIONs

Identification Division (mandatoy)
PROGRAM-ID is the only mandatory paragraph. PROGRAM-ID specifies the program name that can consist 1 to 30 characters.

Environment Division
Environment division is used to specify input and output files to the program. It consists of two sections:
    Configuration section provides information about the system on which the program is written and executed. It consists of two paragraphs −
        Source computer − System used to compile the program.
        Object computer − System used to execute the program.
    Input-Output section provides information about the files to be used in the program. It consists of two paragraphs −
        File control − Provides information of external data sets used in the program.
        I-O control − Provides information of files used in the program.

Data Division
Data division is used to define the variables used in the program. It consists of four sections −
    File section is used to define the record structure of the file.
    Working-Storage section is used to declare temporary variables and file structures which are used in the program.
    Local-Storage section is similar to Working-Storage section. The only difference is that the variables will be allocated and initialized every time a program starts execution.
    Linkage section is used to describe the data names that are received from an external program.

Procedure Division
    Procedure division is used to include the logic of the program. 
    It consists of executable statements using variables defined in the data division. 
    In this division, paragraph and section names are user-defined.

COBOL control structures
conditional statements (IF, EVALUATE)
loops (PERFORM).

Error handling in COBOL
the FILE STATUS clause for file operations
the INVALID KEY and AT END clauses for other operations.

Syntax:
The COBOL Character Set includes 78 characters which are shown below −

Coding Sheet
The source program of COBOL must be written in a format acceptable to the compilers. COBOL programs are written on COBOL coding sheets. There are 80 character positions on each line of a coding sheet.
Character positions are grouped into the following five fields −

Positions	Field	Description
1-6	Column Numbers	Reserved for line numbers.
7	Indicator	It can have Asterisk (*) indicating comments, Hyphen (-) indicating continuation and Slash ( / ) indicating form feed.
8-11	Area A	All COBOL divisions, sections, paragraphs and some special entries must begin in Area A.
12-72	Area B	All COBOL statements must begin in area B.
73-80	Identification Area	It can be used as needed by the programmer.

Variables
are defined in the DATA DIVISION, specifically in the WORKING-STORAGE SECTION

Data Types:
    Numeric:
        PIC 9 for numeric
        PIC S9 for signed numbers
    characters:
        PIC A
    Alphanumeric:
        PIC X for alphanumeric

Definition of a Variable:
Level_Number    Data_Name       Picture_Clause  Value_Clause    End 
01              TOTAL-STUDENTS  PIC9(5)         VALUE '125'     .

Level Number &  Description
01              Record description entry
02 to 49        Group and Elementary items
66              Rename Clause items
77              Items which cannot be sub-divided
88              Condition name entry

Example:
DATA DIVISION.
WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
01 WS-NAME    PIC X(25).                               ---> ELEMENTARY ITEM 
01 WS-CLASS   PIC 9(2)  VALUE  '10'.                   ---> ELEMENTARY ITEM

01 WS-ADDRESS.                                         ---> GROUP ITEM   
   05 WS-HOUSE-NUMBER    PIC 9(3).                     ---> ELEMENTARY ITEM
   05 WS-STREET          PIC X(15).                    ---> ELEMENTARY ITEM
   05 WS-CITY            PIC X(15).                    ---> ELEMENTARY ITEM
   05 WS-COUNTRY         PIC X(15)  VALUE 'INDIA'.     ---> ELEMENTARY ITEM

Naming:
It is a suser defined word that cannot be a reserved word.
Naming conventions prefixes: 
    WS-                 for variables in the Working-Storage Section
    FD-, F-             for File Description section variables
    LK-                 sometimes used for Linkage Section variables
    TEMP-, CNT-, SW-    short for temporary, counter, or switch variables
